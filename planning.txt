about a character adrift at sea
he has strange dreams brought on by sun and exhaustion
each dream is a minigame
if he wins the minigame in his dream he gets something useful
each day his health declines
when he beats the final game he reaches land

minigames: 
driving a bus
rhythm game - classic tap tap with dancing
button mash as things come out of mouth of ui-portraits - this one is WEIRD

things you get:
fish

dvorak: string quartet no 12 in F major op 96 'The American': II. Lento
